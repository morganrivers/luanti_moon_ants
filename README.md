Imagine a future where self-replicating machines slowly colonize the moon and asteroids in the solar system. 

Maybe this would be a good thing, maybe a bad thing. Ideally, it's a good thing, and humanity designs such machines to be of love and grace. That is the intention of this little baby idea - to ensure that when humanity does create self replicating machines to colonize the solar system, it does so in a wise, compassionate way.

But first we need the replicating machines.

What would they look like?

Probably ants. Ants are really good self-replicators. They have dominated over any other resource-gathering animals outside of the oceans.  They're just incredibly well-engineered, and resilient through simple algorithms.

Also, space is hostile. There needs to be an underground nest for any chance of successful self-replication of machines.

Finally, while ants rely on biology, they may not necessarily have to. A similar concept could be created through machine replication - silicon, metals, and motors. Life could be fundamentally silicon and mechanical in origin, mining the materials of space and forming the machines from these, utilizing the energy of the sun as its fuel.

How do we design these ants?

Instead of designing “space ants” outright, you'd use a process of gradual, simulated evolution to discover how such a system might arise.

The plan is something like this:

1. Create a simulated environment, perhaps something like Minecraft (in this case, Minetest, an open source alternative) but tailored for simulating physical constraints, where entities can build, reproduce, and interact with their surroundings.


2. Start with simple challenges—low-gravity, no radiation, abundant resources, minimal energy needs—and allow the ants to evolve in response through continuous simulation. The most successful replicators are allowed through to the next simulations.


3. As certain configurations begin to self-replicate successfully, gradually increase the difficulty of the environment: simulate vacuum, cosmic radiation, energy scarcity, thermal extremes, etc.


4. Over time, evolution within this increasingly realistic space-like simulation would select for increasingly robust and capable systems.


5. The end result might be a set of entities—analogous to ants—that can self-replicate, cooperate, and survive in actual space conditions, perhaps seeding asteroid belts or planetary surfaces with self-sustaining colonies.

Paths
-----
Locations:

* `bin`   - Compiled binaries
* `share` - Distributed read-only data
* `user`  - User-created modifiable data

Where each location is on each platform:

* Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source:
    * `bin`   = `bin`
    * `share` = `.`
    * `user`  = `.`
* Windows installed:
    * `bin`   = `C:\Program Files\Minetest\bin (Depends on the install location)`
    * `share` = `C:\Program Files\Minetest (Depends on the install location)`
    * `user`  = `%APPDATA%\Minetest` or `%MINETEST_USER_PATH%`
* Linux installed:
    * `bin`   = `/usr/bin`
    * `share` = `/usr/share/minetest`
    * `user`  = `~/.minetest` or `$MINETEST_USER_PATH`
* macOS:
    * `bin`   = `Contents/MacOS`
    * `share` = `Contents/Resources`
    * `user`  = `Contents/User` or `~/Library/Application Support/minetest` or `$MINETEST_USER_PATH`

Worlds can be found as separate folders in: `user/worlds/`

Configuration file
------------------
- Default location:
    `user/minetest.conf`
- This file is created by closing Luanti for the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
    `--config <path-to-file>`
- A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in
    `location_of_exe/../minetest.conf` and also `location_of_exe/../../minetest.conf`

Command-line options
--------------------
- Use `--help`

Version scheme
--------------
We use `major.minor.patch` since 5.0.0-dev. Prior to that we used `0.major.minor`.

- Major is incremented when the release contains breaking changes, all other
numbers are set to 0.
- Minor is incremented when the release contains new non-breaking features,
patch is set to 0.
- Patch is incremented when the release only contains bugfixes and very
minor/trivial features considered necessary.

Since 5.0.0-dev and 0.4.17-dev, the dev notation refers to the next release,
i.e.: 5.0.0-dev is the development version leading to 5.0.0.
Prior to that we used `previous_version-dev`.
